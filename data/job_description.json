  "task_description": "## Task\nGenerate a concise yet informative git commit message draft from a `git diff` output. The message should include a title (under 50 characters) and optionally a body for additional context when necessary. The commit message should summarize the changes by identifying what was added, modified, or removed, and explain the purpose or impact of those changes in a clear, technical manner.\n\n## Inputs\nThe raw output string from the `git diff` command, which shows changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc. This includes file paths, added/removed lines, and change context across multiple files. The diff may include code modifications, new files, deleted files, and comments indicating the nature of changes.\n\n## Outputs\nA string in conventional git commit message format: a title line (<=50 characters) followed by an optional blank line and a body paragraph for elaboration. The body should provide specific details about the changes made, including functionality added, bugs fixed, or architectural improvements. Omit the body if the title sufficiently describes the changes.",
